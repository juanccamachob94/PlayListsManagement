# PlayList Management
A basic playlist manager is added in order to register, update and remove playlists from their data source url. This project seeks to remove attributes not used by the client from the original resource and in turn add the new attribute `thumbnail_image_url` that is required for a specific view that the client that consumes this url needs.
